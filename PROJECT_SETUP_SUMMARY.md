```

---

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Push Database Schema Changes

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 2. Add Images from Subfolders

To display images from `clubhouse/`, `floorplans/`, and `gallery/` folders:

**Option A: Provide the filenames**
List all image filenames in each folder, and I'll create a script to add them to the database.

**Option B: Use a bulk upload script**
I can create a script that fetches all files from a Vercel Blob folder and adds them automatically (requires Vercel Blob API access).

Example format for filenames:

```javascript
// clubhouse folder
;['clubhouse-01.jpg', 'clubhouse-02.jpg', 'gym.jpg', 'pool.jpg'][
  // floorplans folder
  ('3bhk-typeA.jpg', '3bhk-typeB.jpg', '4bhk-typeA.jpg')
][
  // gallery folder
  ('exterior-01.jpg', 'lobby.jpg', 'landscaping.jpg')
]
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Adding More Projects**: Use the same pattern. Create a script similar to `add-myhome-apas.ts` for each project.

2. **Updating Project Data**: Modify the `projectDetails` JSON in the database directly or create an update script.

3. **Managing Promotions**: Use the promote APIs. Set `totalDays` (max 5) and payment amount (currently ₹0).

4. **Verifying Emails**: Check Resend dashboard for sent emails when testing Express Interest.
